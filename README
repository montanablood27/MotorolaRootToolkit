Hello!

Motorola Toolkit is designed to allow you to perform modifications to your Motorola G3 Device that could otherwise be pretty intimidating and dangerous!

This includes downgrading the Android version to Lollipop from Marshmallow. This tool will also allow you to root your device, and flash custom recoveries.

You should install the Motorola USB Driver before launching the application ( A link is provided within the Python GUI )
